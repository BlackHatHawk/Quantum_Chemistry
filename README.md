# Quantum_Chemistry

Electron density plot of 3d and 4f orbitals are in 'results' folder.

A simulation of Mossbauer spectra is in Mossbauer_spect.ipynb file.

A simulation of postion of partical in 1D box by monte-carlo method in (free_particle.ipynb) file.

Chemical_kinetics folder contains files that simulate ideal nature of chemical reaction (not any connection with quantum chemistry).

#Explaination of files:

Function.py contains general mathmatical functions or operations usefull in quantum chemistry
GraphFunction.py contains functions that help in ploting of graph
Operators.py contains definition of quantum operators defined with the help of Function.py file
Wavefunction.py contains definition of wavefunction used in quantum chemistry such as Radial and angular wavefunction of hydrogen atom.
