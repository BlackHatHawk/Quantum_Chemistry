# Quantum_Chemistry

Electron density plot of 3d and 4f orbitals are in [results](https://github.com/BlackHatHawk/Quantum_Chemistry/edit/main/Calculated_results) folder.

A simulation of Mossbauer spectra is in [Mossbauer_spect.ipynb](https://github.com/BlackHatHawk/Quantum_Chemistry/blob/main/Mossbauer_spect.ipynb) file.

A simulation of postion of partical in 1D box by monte-carlo method in [free_particle.ipynb](https://github.com/BlackHatHawk/Quantum_Chemistry/blob/main/free_particle.ipynb) file.

[Chemical_kinetics](https://github.com/BlackHatHawk/Quantum_Chemistry/blob/main/Chemical_kinetics) folder contains files that simulate ideal nature of chemical reaction (not any connection with quantum chemistry).

## Explaination of files:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Function.py contains general mathmatical functions or operations usefull in quantum chemistry.

GraphFunction.py contains functions that help in ploting of graph.

Operators.py contains definition of quantum operators defined with the help of Function.py file.

Wavefunction.py contains definition of wavefunction used in quantum chemistry such as Radial and angular wavefunction of hydrogen atom.
